# pike

I just looked into pike because it was a recommended languates with a Gnueric installation.

Some sources discovered so far:

* [a pike beginner's guide with an outdated GTK part](https://pike.lysator.liu.se/docs/tut/introduction/first_glance.md)
* [a Pike GTK2 reference with no examples](https://pike.lysator.liu.se/generated/manual/modref/ex/predef_3A_3A/GTK2.html)
* [a good GTK tutorial which needs strong adaptation to pike GTK](https://developer.gnome.org/gtk-tutorial/stable/)
